        <br> <p style="margin-left:20px;"> The Epoka has updated its system by putting the booking the teacher/student has to
        make about choosing his preferred transportation method. You need to go to the left of your page and 
        two sections, "Student Transport Information" and "Teacher Transport Information" will appear.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;"> You can choose one of them, if you want to view the status of the bookings
        for either the student or the teacher. Anything saved by them will be sent to this page. Meanwhile, you can watch
        two videos on advisor tips.</p>  <br>
