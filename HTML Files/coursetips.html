        <h5 style="margin-top:31px; margin-left:10px;"> <b>Here are some strategies to help you choose your classes. </b></h5> <br>

        <h5>1. Check out your options for your course track</h5>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the available courses prior to meeting with your adviser. 
During your first and second years, you’ll take many of your required core classes. 
However, you’ll also have space for elective courses. 
This is an opportunity for you to take courses that spark your interest.</p>

<h5>2. Visit your college advisor </h5>

<p>Colleges have advisors to assist students with the selection of their courses and to make sure they’re on 
    track to satisfy their degree requirements. Try to meet with your adviser before registering for classes
     to receive guidance on what courses to take your first year. Show up for the meeting with a list of questions. </p>


     <h5>3. Ask others about courses</h5>
<p>Talk to students who’ve taken courses you’re interested in. 
    They can give offer insight into the class and the professors, 
    and they can give you tips on how to be successful. While you’re at it, ask your fellow students 
    to suggest good classes to take. You can set up appointments with professors 
    who teach the courses you want to take and ask questions.</p>


<h5>4. Make a schedule that works for you</h5>
<p>If you want to be a full-time student, take at least 12 credit hours per semester. 
    This breaks down into four courses, each worth three credit hours. 
    You’ll be able to choose courses offered morning, afternoon, or evening.
     Some schools offer courses online in addition to in person. Some courses 
     take place daily while others take place two or three times a week. 
     Consider the time you’ll need for studying, work, 
     and extracurricular activities when making 
     your schedule. </p>
<h5>5. Get your degree requirements out of the way</h5>
<p>During your first two years, you'll take required courses 
    before diving into your major courses later on. When you meet with 
    your adviser, make sure you have a clear understanding of what your 
    core requirements are, and plot out when you’ll take each one.</p>
<h5>6. College credit, advanced placement, or both lessen class load</h5>
<p>If you've taken AP or IB classes, find out if you can use them to fulfill 
    any core requirements before you register. You can also be placed in a more advanced course 
    by scoring well on a college placement exam.</p>



    <h5>7. Do not jump to hard courses right away.</h5> <p>You may want to jump into difficult courses or sign up for a heavy course load immediately. But keep in mind that college courses require more time and effort than high school classes. One of the most valuable college schedule tips to remember is to start with a course load you can handle. This helps you set yourself up for success. </p>
<h5>8. Register for classes as soon as registration opens</h5>
<p>The earlier you register, the more likely you’ll get classes you want. If a problem comes up along the way, you'll 
    have more time to deal with it. But regardless of how early you register, make sure you have a list of backup classes.
     That way, you'll have alternatives if some of your first choices are no longer available.</p>
