                     the complex issues surrounding Albania's security. 
                     AIIS was founded by a group of academics and analysts
                      with extensive experience in foreign policy and policy-making issues. Since then, AIIS has sharpened its 
                      technical capacities to become a leading think-tank trusted by Albanian policy-makers 
                      and international partners in the fields of security studies, democracy, Euro-Atlantic integration,
                and regional cooperation. In order to promote discussion and debate among the policy community,
                 AIIS engages Albanian and international scholars as well as provides its products free of charge on its website. 
                 These services are made possible by the contributions of the national and international donor community 
                 to fund its activities. As a results-oriented, methodologically interdisciplinary team, AIIS aims to produce timely
                  advice as well as analysis of the challenges facing Albania's policy-makers. 
                  Given the changing nature of security threats, AIIS has turned to domestic issues 
                  such as democratization as primary challenges to a secure and stable Albania. 
                  Having carved out a niche in the policy-making environment, 
                    AIIS has become an important partner in Albania's road to democratization and a market economy. <br>
