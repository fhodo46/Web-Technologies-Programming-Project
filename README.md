# Web-Technologies-Programming-Project
This project intends to show how the Epoka University EIS system works.
The website has three levels of login: the student, the teacher, and the advisor.


The student has access to his grades, personal information, files where he can add documents, pages where he can upload files, book bus transportations, select courses etc.
The teacher has access to some of the sites the student has, but he can also keep track of students' information and save the hours in which the student has been present.
The advisor has the superior role because he controls both the student and the teacher. He has access to watching Epoka videos, saving information about the bookings that are made by students or teachers, view uploaded file from students/teachers, etc.

The whole project consits of 41 HTML files, 78 images, 15 PHP CRUD + API files, 1 separate CSS file, and 12 audio files.

Everything in this project is original. Applications may have been used only to correct errors because of the limited timeframe of the project.
