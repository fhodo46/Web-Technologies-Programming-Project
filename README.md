# Web-Technologies-Programming-Project
This project intends to show how the Epoka University EIS system works.



It first starts with an interactive login system, similar to that of EIS. However, the user does not require clicking a button before seeing the login webpage because it is in front of him.  The user will be asked to enter his username and a password to login, as usual, and this part is properly validated to keep the user and others away from malicious attacks that may happen.

After the student logs in, he/she sees his corresponding student site, where he/she can check his grades, find information about jobs, see the courses he has taken and will retake/take next year,  his attendance, transcript, as well as his financial status about the tuitions he has to pay for it, if any. Some more functionalities of the student include applying for additional exams (in case he has not succeeded from a course in his Bachelor studies and he/she wants to try it again after the duration of the study program), seeing the timetable (for both transport/lecture hours), booking a private transportation schedule, etc.

About the teacher, it is slightly different from the student in that that its functionalities differ. He approves student requests and adds grades on their system. About exams (midterm/final), the teacher does not know the student codes, so he assigns the grade to the code and then this grade is sent to the student. This process is done anonymously and the teacher is not supposed to know the name of the student he/she assigns the grade to.

The admin has the highest priority. His task is to accept requests coming from both the teacher and the student. He adds/removes the teachers/students to the system and has information regarding the teacher/student at his hand, including information such as the CV or any student documents that are associated with Epoka.

In short, this is a simplified version of how an interactive system of a university like Epoka looks like. This work is original and there is no plagiarism in it other than the fact that we have used ready-made Bootstrap templates.
